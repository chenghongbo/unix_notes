=== ansible ===

Tasks:
	 contain the core logic, for example, they will have code specifications
	to install packages, start services, manage files, and so on. If we consider a
	role to be a movie, a task would be the protagonist.

Vars:
	and defaults provide data about your application/role, for example,
	which port your server should run on, the path for storing the application
	data, which user to run the service as, and so on. 

handlers: 
	like a function or method in OOP, handlers are actions that can be called (or notified, in ansible terms) when a certain event occur

Files and templates:
	provide options for managing files. 
	Typically, the files subdirectory is used to copy over static files to destination hosts,
	whereas templates are used to generate files with dynamic contents, with help from variables
