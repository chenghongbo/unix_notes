    """
    dest: You will access the value of option with this variable
    help: This text gets displayed whey someone uses --help.
    default: If the command line argument was not specified, it will get this default value.
    action: Actions tell optparse what to do when it encounters an option on the command line. action defaults to store. These actions are available:
        store: take the next argument (or the remainder of the current argument), ensure that it is of the correct type, and store it to your chosen destination dest.
        store_true: store True in dest if this flag was set.
        store_false: store False in dest if this flag was set.
        store_const: store a constant value
        append: append this optionâ€™s argument to a list
        count: increment a counter by one
        callback: call a specified function
        nargs: ArgumentParser objects usually associate a single command-line argument with a single action to be taken. The nargs keyword argument associates a different number of command-line arguments with a single action.
        required: Mark a command line argument as non-optional (required).
        choices: Some command-line arguments should be selected from a restricted set of values. These can be handled by passing a container object as the choices keyword argument to add_argument(). When the command line is parsed, argument values will be checked, and an error message will be displayed if the argument was not one of the acceptable values.
        type: Use this command, if the argument is of another type (e.g. int or float).
