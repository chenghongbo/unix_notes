    dest: You will access the value of option with this variable
    help: This text gets displayed whey someone uses --help.

        store: take the next argument (or the remainder of the current argument), ensure that it is of the correct type, and store it to your chosen destination dest.
        store_true: store True in dest if this flag was set.
        store_false: store False in dest if this flag was set.

        choices: Some command-line arguments should be selected from a restricted set of values. These can be handled by passing a container object as the choices keyword argument to add_argument(). When the command line is parsed, argument values will be checked, and an error message will be displayed if the argument was not one of the acceptable values.
        type: Use this command, if the argument is of another type (e.g. int or float).

Basic patterns:

    a, X, 9, < -- ordinary characters just match themselves exactly. The meta-characters which do not match themselves because they have special meanings are: . ^ $ * + ? { [ ] \ | ( ) (details below)
    . (a period) -- matches any single character except newline '\n'
    \w -- (lowercase w) matches a "word" character: a letter or digit or underbar [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Note that although "word" is the mnemonic for this, it only matches a single word char, not a whole word. \W (upper case W) matches any non-word character.
    \b -- boundary between word and non-word
    \s -- (lowercase s) matches a single whitespace character -- space, newline, return, tab, form [ \n\r\t\f]. \S (upper case S) matches any non-whitespace character.
    \t, \n, \r -- tab, newline, return
    \d -- decimal digit [0-9] (some older regex utilities do not support but \d, but they all support \w and \s)
    ^ = start, $ = end -- match the start or end of the string
    \ -- inhibit the "specialness" of a character. So, for example, use \. to match a period or \\ to match a slash. If you are unsure if a character has special meaning, such as '@', you can put a slash in front of it, \@, to make sure it is treated just as a character.

Meta characters in python re
    . ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )

    \d
    Matches any decimal digit; this is equivalent to the class [0-9].
    \D
    Matches any non-digit character; this is equivalent to the class [^0-9].
    \s
    Matches any whitespace character; this is equivalent to the class [ \t\n\r\f\v].
    \S
    Matches any non-whitespace character; this is equivalent to the class [^ \t\n\r\f\v].
    \w
    Matches any alphanumeric character; this is equivalent to the class [a-zA-Z0-9_].
    \W
    Matches any non-alphanumeric character; this is equivalent to the class [^a-zA-Z0-9_].


    The re functions take options to modify the behavior of the pattern match. The option flag is added as an extra argument to the search() or findall() etc., e.g. re.search(pat, str, re.IGNORECASE).

    IGNORECASE -- ignore upper/lowercase differences for matching, so 'a' matches both 'a' and 'A'.
    DOTALL -- allow dot (.) to match newline -- normally it matches anything but newline. This can trip you up -- you think .* matches everything, but by default it does not go past the end of a line. Note that \s (whitespace) includes newlines, so if you want to match a run of whitespace that may include a newline, you can just use \s*
    MULTILINE -- Within a string made of many lines, allow ^ and $ to match the start and end of each line. Normally ^/$ would just match the start and end of the whole string.
