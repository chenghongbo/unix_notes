This repo my learning notes on various tools/technologies,
often labeled by its filename, like dtrace.d is for DTrace.

While the work_notes.txt is to log some of the stuff I had
learn to get my work done, and I think I'll need them sometime
later, so I wrote it down to save some time for next time.

There are some other stuff in here, completedly temperary or 
useless for anybody other than myself. Just wrote it down so 
that I can access them when I switch among different computers.
